# ARK Server Settings

This repository contains a collection of ARK: Survival Evolved server setting templates, based on the settings used by **Syntac** on his ASE servers.

Syntac is a well-known ARK content creator, and these settings aim to replicate the gameplay experience featured in his YouTube series. 
Whether you're setting up a solo world or a private server with friends, these templates can help you match the balance and feel of Syntac's servers.

These files are cloned from his [Ragnarok server settings](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/3506218156/596278429494572204/).
